#String is a piece of text
It is written within ' ' or " "

To write a long string '''    ''' are used 

#assign a string to a variable
a = 'apple'
print(a)

#multiline string
a = '''My name is Yuvraj and I am a boy.
       I study at MIT-Adt'''

#Strings are Arrays
Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.
a = 'Python'
print(a[1])

#looping through a string
for x in 'banana':
    print(x)

#string length
x = 'Hello, World'
print(len(x))

#check string
To check if a certain phrase or character is present in a string, we can use the keyword in.
txt = 'this is a free world'
print('free' in txt)

Use it in an if statement

txt = 'I am Yuvraj and I am a good boy'
if 'Yuvraj' in txt:
    print("'Yes, 'Yuvraj' is there in txt.")

#Check if NOT
To check if a certain phrase or character is NOT present in a string, we can use the keyword not in.
txt = "The best things in life are free!"
print("expensive" not in txt) just opp of if in

#slicing
a = 'Hello, World'
print(a[2:5])

slice from the start
a = 'Hello, World'
print(a[:5])

slice to the end
a = 'Hello, World'
print(a[1:])

Negative Indexing
Use negative indexes to start the slice from the end of the string
a = "Hello, World!"
print(a[-5:-2]) (if we put a positive value after using - the code will not work)

#modify strings
a = 'Hello, World'
print(a(upper()) (it will print all the characters to upper case)

a = "Hello, World!"
print(a.lower()) (it will print all the characters to lower case)

#Remove Whitespace
Whitespace is the space before and/or after the actual text, and very often you want to remove this space.
a = " Hello, World! "
print(a.strip()) # returns "Hello, World!"

#Replace Strings
a = 'hello, world'
print(a.replace 'h', 'j')

#Split String
The split() method returns a list where the text between the specified separator becomes the list items.
a = "Hello, World!"
print(a.split(",")) # returns ['Hello', ' World!']

#String Concatenation
To concatenate, or combine, two strings you can use the + operator.
a = 'Yuvraj'
b = 'Pradhan'
print(a + ' ' + b)

#String Format
we cannot add strings and numbers, if we want to do so we must format the number or int to str)
a = 'My age is'
b = 18
print(a + ' '  + str(b))

The format() method takes an unlimited number of arguments, and are placed into the respective placeholders:
my_fruits = 'i have {} oranges, and {} apple, and {} guavas'
b = 10
c = 5
d = 12
print(my_fruits.format(b, c, d))

#Escape Character
An escape character is a backslash \ followed by the character you want to insert.
txt = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north."
\'	Single Quote	
\\	Backslash	
\n	New Line	
\r	Carriage Return	
\t	Tab	
\b	Backspace	
\f	Form Feed	
\ooo	Octal value	
\xhh	Hex value

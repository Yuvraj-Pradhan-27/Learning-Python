#Way to store data in the compurter

name = Yuvraj (name is the variable)
(process of assigning the value is binding)

python is case sensitive

#cases in python
snake case - my_name(everything lowercase connected with _)
camel case - myName(every word starts with uppercase except first word)
pascal case - MyName(every word starts with uppercase)

#assigning multiple values
x, y, z = 1, 2, 3

#assigning one value to many
x = y = z = "orange"

#unpack data
fruits ["apple, banana, orange"]
x, y, z = fruits
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

#output variable
x = "Python is awesome"
print(x)

x = Python
y = Is
z = Awesome
print(x, y, z)
OR
x = Python
y = Is
z = Awesome
print(x + y + z)

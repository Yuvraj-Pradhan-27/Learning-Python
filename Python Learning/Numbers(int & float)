#They come under the fundamental data type

print(6) 6
print(2-4) -2
print(2*4) 8
print(2/4) 0.5 (All will give mathematical output)

print(type(6)) Int
print(type(2-4)) Int
print(type(2*4)) Int
print(type(2/4)) Float (The output will be what type of data it is)

(If it is a whole number it's int data and if decimal it's float data)

Let's take 10.56 to understand more about float
It is hard for the computer to understand and store 10.56 as it has (.) so what the .computer does is it stores 10 and 56 differently

int + int = int
int + float = float
float + float = float
float + int = float

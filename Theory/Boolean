#Booleans can be true or false

name = Yuvraj

#Evaluate Values and Variables

#Most Values are True
Almost any value is evaluated to True if it has some sort of content.
Any string is True, except empty strings.
Any number is True, except 0.
Any list, tuple, set, and dictionary are True, except empty ones.

#Some Values are False
bool(False)
bool(None)
bool(0)
bool("")
bool(())
bool([])
bool({})

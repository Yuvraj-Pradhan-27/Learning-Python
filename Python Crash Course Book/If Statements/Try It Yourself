#5-1. Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests . Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test . Your code should look something like this:
  #car = 'subaru'
  #print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
  #print(car == 'subaru')
  #print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.")
  #print(car == 'audi')
  #--Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False .
  #--Create at least 10 tests . Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False .

#5-2. More Conditional Tests: You don’t have to limit the number of tests you create to 10 . If you want to try more comparisons, write more tests and add them to conditional_tests.py . Have at least one True and one False result for each of the following:
  #--Tests for equality and inequality with strings
  #--Tests using the lower() function
  #Numerical tests involving equality and inequality, greater than and less than, greater than or equal to, and less than or equal to
  #--Tests using the and keyword and the or keyword
  #--Test whether an item is in a list
  #--Test whether an item is not in a list

#5-3. Alien Colors 1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
  #--Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points .

#5-6. Stages of Life: Write an if-elif-else chain that determines a person’s stage of life . Set a value for the variable age, and then:
  #--If the person is less than 2 years old, print a message that the person is a baby .
  #--If the person is at least 2 years old but less than 4, print a message that the person is a toddler .
